        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These cookies are my husband's favorites, especially when they 
                have a good crunch. The cookies are great for those in your life
                 that don't enjoy chocolate and just everyone. They aren't too 
                 sweet, which seems to be a theme in my favorite desert recipes. 
                 The recipe is an adaption from an original Betty Crocker 70's 
                 oatmeal cookie recipe. Enjoy!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 Cup nuts walnut or pecans (chopped)</li>
                <li>/2 Cup unsweetened coconut (shredded)</li>
                <li>1/3 Cup Brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/3 Cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 Cup quick oats</li>
                <li>1 Cup old fashioned oats</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (add additional 1/3 tsp when 
                    using unsalted butter)</li>
                <li>1 stick melted butter (1/2C) (salted) / 113 grams</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li class="temp">Preheat oven: 350 degrees/176.67 Cel.</li>
                <li>Mix together all dry ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add wet ingredients next - I've found that 
                    this really has an impact on the way the cookies 
                    turn out.
                </li>
                <li>Use spoon to drop balls on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet - the dough will be sticky but doesn't 
                    stick together that well. I usually flatten mine a little bit so they 
                    aren't so rounded. I like them smaller and bigger, you just need to see 
                    how large you'd like them - they don't spread out much during cooking.
                </li>
                <li>Bake for ~20 minutes, until the bottom and top of cookies are a deep 
                    golden brown - but not burnt.
                </li>
                <li>Remove to cool on a cookie sheet.</li>
            </ol>
