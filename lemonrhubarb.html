                <li>¾ c. butter, softened</li>
                <li>½ c. sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>2 c. flour</li>

            <ol>
                <li class="temp">Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl cream together the butter, brown sugar,
                     and sugar. Add in the egg and mix well.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix well. 
                    Your dough may be a little dry at this point.</li>

                     until well combined.

                <li>Drop the dough onto un-greased cookie sheets by heaping tablespoons. 
                    Place the cookies at least 2 inches apart.</li>
                <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the cookies are just
                     starting to brown slightly.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 2 minutes before removing them to
                     a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
