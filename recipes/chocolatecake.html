        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This moist and simple chocolate cake has become a family favorite. We 
                prefer to bake this cake in a 9x13 glass pan without frosting for a 
                rich, but not too sweet treat to be enjoyed for breakfast or desert. I've 
                adjusted the recipe in accordance to my tastes for more coco powder and 
                less sugar.
